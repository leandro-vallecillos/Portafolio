Leandro's Engineering and Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: Data Science Predicting Prices tool for New York City Properties](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T3qrwWRKGSIzSPVC1OVmCB14D1uqbS3N?usp=sharing)
* Created a tool that predicts the prices of properties in the five differents Boroughs of New York City, based on properties variables.
* Scrape a year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market using R, for over 80,000 transactions.
* Optimized linear, logistic, and random forest regressions to find the best modeling approach.

# [Project 2: Engineering Research project for Supply Chain Risk Management Systems using Monte Carlo Simulation (Spanish)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UjHlhK7ARhKaXYqlQqyKLp-PuxKHhrB-?usp=sharing)
* Created a risk management system for electronic manfucturing companies.
* Used ISO norms as ISO 31000, for directing the risk management evaluation system in a real electronics company.
* Analyzed the cost-benefit alternatives using Monte Carlo Simulations.
* Proposed solutions based on the risks.

# [Project 3: Engineering Sustainability Research Project: Comparative Life Cycle Assesstement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/126itl2Af-ikFVASQvrBbq50Hs3cdmKiO/view?usp=sharing)
* Assessed the environmental impact using the Global Warming Potential and Kg CO2 equivalent.
* Compared the life cycle of two types of food: Vegan vs Omnivorous.
* Built and analyzed an inventory analysis for processes, energy consumption, and material flow.

# [Project 4: Data Science Movie Recommendation System](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19U_1FaPJu2lm_htkqgUEK8xyfAcWpmh9/view?usp=sharing)
* Conducted a predictive model using varios machine learning tools to recommend movies as in Netflix or Hulu apps.
* Analyzed a dataset of 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users.
* Visualized data and explained the model to external audience.
