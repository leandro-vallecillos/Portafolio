Leandro's Engineering and Data Science Projects

# (Project 1: Data Science Predicting Prices tool for New York City Properties) (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T3qrwWRKGSIzSPVC1OVmCB14D1uqbS3N?usp=sharing)
* Created a tool that predicts the prices of properties in the five differents Boroughs of New York City, based on properties variables.
* Scrape a year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market using R, for over 80,000 transactions.
* Optimized linear, logistic, and random forest regressions to find the best modeling approach.

# (Project 2: Engineering Research project for Supply Chain Risk Management Systems using Monte Carlo Simulation (Spanish)) (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UjHlhK7ARhKaXYqlQqyKLp-PuxKHhrB-?usp=sharing)
* Created a risk management system for electronic manfucturing companies.
* Used ISO norms as ISO 31000, for directing the risk management evaluation system in a real electronics company.
* Analyzed the cost-benefit alternatives using Monte Carlo Simulations.
* Proposed solutions based on the risks.

# Project 3: Engineering Sustainability Research Project: Comparative Life Cycle Assesstement 
* Assessed the environmental impact using the Global Warming Potential and Kg CO2 equivalent.
* Compared the life cycle of two types of food: Vegan vs Omnivorous.
* Analyzed the CO2 equivalent based on System Boundaries.

# Project 4: Data Science Movie Recommendation System
